Description:
    Creates dummy data for the application. The amount of generated records is
    dependent on a base amount and a growth ratio. The base amount is related 
    to the initial amount of records to generate, which is then incremented
    based on their has_many associations using a given growth ratio.

    If the base amount is 10, the growth ratio is 2.0, GrandParents have many
    Parents and Parents have many Children, the generator will create dummy
    data for 10 GrandParents, 20 Parents and 40 Children.

Example:
    `rails generate dummy:data`

    It creates YAML fixtures for every model under:
        test/dummy/
